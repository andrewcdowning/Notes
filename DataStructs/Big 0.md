Assymtotic analysis

 \- Studying how funtion time/size changes as input changes

#### Time Complexity

- O(1) -> Constant time, as n increases, time remains constant
- O(log(n)) -> Logarithmic
- O(n) -> Linear
- O(nlog(n))-> Log Linear
- O(n2) -> Quadratic
- O(n3) -> Cubic
- O(2n) -> Exponential
- O(n!) -> Factorial
