# Comments and formatting

## Comments

Comments should be avoided with a few exceptions. Comments add redundant information and can actually make code harder to read.

#### Bad Comments:
---
* redundant info
* Block markers or dividers
* Misleading comments
* Commented out code

#### Good Comments:
---
* Legal info
* Explanation that adds context where names cannot
* Warnings
* TODO's - minimize
* Doc strings - only for modules that others will use 


## Formatting


#### Vertical
---
* Should make code readable like an easy from top to bottom with minimal jumping
* Split files with multiple concepts
* Split different areas of code with spaces
* related concepts should stay together


#### Horizontal
---
* line width
* space between phrases
* indentation
* avoid long sentences, use indentation
* be mindful of line length
