Guards: Invert if checks to fail fast and return.  This is effiecent at un nesting code.



Extracting control structures:
* prefer positive phrasing
* check for the TRUE case (easier to read)
Invert Conditional logic

Errors and Handling
* throwing and handling errors can replace if statements and lead to more focused code.
* Simple rule, if its an error make it an error
** Error handling is ONE thing


Factory Functions produce something
Polymorphism - Function or object can be used in the same way

Always avoid deep nesting - > use polymorphism and factory functions - use errors
prefer positive checks
(if isEmpty vs is notEmpty)
