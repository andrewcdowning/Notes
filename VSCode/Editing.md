# Editing

# Multi-Cursor Editing
1. Box Selection - press any combination of *⇧↑, ⇧↓, ⇧←, ⇧→* to select a block of text. 
2. Add a cursor - press *⌥⌘⇧* to add a new cursor above or *⌥⌘↓* to add a cursor below. *⌥+Click* with mouse to add a cursor anywhere. 
3. Create cursors on all occurrences of a string - select one instance of a string e.g. background-color and press *⇧⌘L*. Now you
can replace all instances by simply typing.


# Multi-Line Actions
Since it's very common to work with the entire text in a line we provide a set of useful shortcuts to help with this.
1. Copy a line and insert it above or below the current position with ⇧⌥↓ or ⇧⌥↑ respectively.
2. Move an entire line or selection of lines up or down with ⌥↓ and ⌥↑ respectively.
3. Delete the entire line with ⇧⌘K.


# Rename Refactoring
It's easy to rename a symbol such as a function name or variable name. Hit F2 while in the symbol Book to rename all instances - this will
occur across all files in a project. You also have Rename Symbol in the right-click context menu

# Formatting
Keeping your code looking great is hard without a good formatter. Luckily it's easy to format content, either for the
entire document with ⇧⌥ F or for the current selection with ⌘K ⌘F. Both of these options are also available through the
right-click context menu.
